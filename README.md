# BlogDeCafe

In this opportunity we worked and reinforced HTML and CSS making a coffee blog where several tabs were implemented, movement and interaction between them, roots were applied for the css and layout of global, header, form, contact and footer. 

The application of media queries and the importance of web optimization were understood.
